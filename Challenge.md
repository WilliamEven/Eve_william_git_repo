# Responsible Web Design Challenge

## Requirements 

This is the pure responsible web design challenge. You don’t need some other frameworks and libraries. Only we will check your HTML, CSS and Javascript. In attached video, you can see several screens but we don’t need all of them. We only see the first screen section and login section. Explain more in details section. 

## What we expect from your code

* Clean code
* Consistent style
* Extensibility
* Maintainability
* Testability

## Extra details
* No styling is needed, simple raw HTML is fine 
* You're welcome to use Create React App or any other tool to bootstrap your project. 
* Don't use any extra libraries or external functions(Extra button, Pic and so on)
Each Film element should display: 

* Random Picture
* Random Color
* Manual Slide
* Show Bottom Slide Section
* When press the 'Skip' button, Display Login Section
